# Cross-Topic Query Handling

**Date**: October 6, 2025  
**Feature**: Cross-Topic Detection and Guidance  
**Status**: ✅ Implemented

---

## 🎯 Problem Solved

### The Issue

Users often ask questions about different topics while in a specific topic section:

**Example Scenarios**:

- User selects **"Programs & Courses"** → Asks **"What are the admission requirements?"**
- User selects **"Admissions"** → Asks **"Tell me about BS Computer Science"**
- User selects **"Fees"** → Asks **"What documents do I need?"**

### Previous Behavior

```
❌ OLD: System tries to find admission info in program-filtered documents
❌ Result: "I don't have specific information about that in the Programs topic"
❌ User Experience: Confusing, unhelpful
```

### New Behavior

```
✅ NEW: System detects cross-topic query
✅ Result: Helpful guidance to switch topics
✅ User Experience: Clear direction, better UX
```

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### 1. Cross-Topic Detection Method

**File**: `backend/chatbot/fast_hybrid_chatbot_together.py`  
**Method**: `_detect_cross_topic_query(query: str) -> Optional[str]`

**How it works**:

1. **Keyword Analysis**: Analyzes query for topic-specific keywords
2. **Scoring System**: Counts keyword matches per topic
3. **Threshold**: Requires ≥2 keyword matches to detect cross-topic
4. **Return**: Best matching topic if different from current

### 2. Topic Keywords Database

```python
topic_keywords = {
    'admissions_enrollment': [
        'admission', 'requirements', 'application', 'entrance', 'apply',
        'enrollment', 'registration', 'enroll', 'register',
        'new student', 'freshman', 'first year', 'incoming',
        'scholar', 'scholarship', 'financial aid', 'grant',
        'transferee', 'transfer', 'shifter', 'lateral entry',
        'international', 'foreign student', 'foreign', 'overseas',
        'documents', 'transcript', 'diploma', 'certificate',
        'form 137', 'form 138', 'birth certificate', 'medical certificate',
        'recommendation letter', 'essay', 'portfolio',
        'entrance exam', 'interview', 'assessment'
    ],
    'programs_courses': [
        'program', 'degree', 'course', 'major', 'bachelor',
        'undergraduate', 'college', 'school', 'department', 'faculty',
        'BS', 'BA', 'curriculum', 'courses', 'subjects', 'syllabus',
        'computer science', 'BS CS', 'BSCS', 'BS COMSCI',
        'information technology', 'BS IT', 'BSIT',
        'business management', 'BSBM', 'accountancy', 'BSA',
        'nursing', 'BSN', 'BS Nursing'
    ],
    'fees': [
        'fees', 'tuition', 'payment', 'cost', 'price', 'amount', 'billing',
        'payment plan', 'installment', 'due date', 'payment schedule',
        'down payment', 'balance', 'discount',
        'miscellaneous fees', 'laboratory fees', 'library fees',
        'graduation fee', 'examination fee', 'registration fee',
        'development fee', 'student activities fee'
    ]
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Query Processing

**Method**: `_process_topic_query()` (Line 2064-2120)

**New Flow**:

```python
def _process_topic_query(self, query: str, topic_id: str):
    # 1. Detect cross-topic query
    detected_topic = self._detect_cross_topic_query(query)

    # 2. If different topic detected
    if detected_topic and detected_topic != topic_id:
        return cross_topic_guidance_response()

    # 3. Otherwise, proceed with normal topic processing
    return normal_topic_processing()
```

## 📝 Response Examples

### Cross-Topic Detection Response

**User in Programs, asks about Admissions**:

```
I notice you're asking about **General Admissions and Enrollment**,

3. Ask your question again

This will ensure you get the most relevant and up-to-date information for your query.
```

**User in Fees, asks about Programs**:

```
I notice you're asking about **Programs and Courses**,

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### Cross-Topic Test Cases

| Current Topic  | User Query                                | Detected Topic | Expected Behavior    |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------- | -------------------- |
| **Programs**   | "What are the admission requirements?"    | **Admissions** | Suggest topic change |
| **Admissions** | "Tell me about BS Computer Science"       | **Programs**   | Suggest topic change |
| **Programs**   | "How much is tuition for BS Nursing?"     | **Fees**       | Suggest topic change |
| **Fees**       | "What documents do I need for admission?" | **Admissions** | Suggest topic change |
| **Admissions** | "What are the tuition fees?"              | **Fees**       | Suggest topic change |
| **Fees**       | "What courses are in Computer Science?"   | **Programs**   | Suggest topic change |

### Same-Topic Test Cases (Should Work Normally)

| Current Topic  | User Query                                    | Expected Behavior |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| **Admissions** | "What are the requirements for new students?" | Normal response   |
| **Programs**   | "What courses are in Computer Science?"       | Normal response   |
| **Fees**       | "What are the tuition fees for BS Nursing?"   | Normal response   |

## 🔍 Detection Algorithm

### Keyword Matching Process

1. **Lowercase Conversion**: Convert query to lowercase
2. **Keyword Scanning**: Check each topic's keyword list
3. **Match Counting**: Count matches per topic
4. **Scoring**: Track scores for each topic
5. **Threshold Check**: Require ≥2 matches for detection
6. **Best Match**: Return topic with highest score
7. **Cross-Topic Check**: Compare with current topic

### Example Detection

**Query**: "What are the admission requirements for new students?"

**Keyword Analysis**:

- `admissions_enrollment`: 3 matches ("admission", "requirements", "new students")
- `programs_courses`: 0 matches
- `fees`: 0 matches

**Result**: Detected topic = `admissions_enrollment`

**If current topic = `programs_courses`**: Cross-topic detected! ✅

3. **Extensible**: Pattern works for any number of topics
4. **Debuggable**: Clear detection logic and scoring

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### Adjusting Detection Sensitivity

**Current Threshold**: ≥2 keyword matches  
**Location**: `_detect_cross_topic_query()` method

```python
# Only consider it a cross-topic query if there are at least 2 keyword matches
if topic_scores[best_topic] >= 2:
    return best_topic
```

**To make more sensitive** (detect more cross-topics):

```python
if topic_scores[best_topic] >= 1:  # Lower threshold
    return best_topic
```

**To make less sensitive** (detect fewer cross-topics):

```python
if topic_scores[best_topic] >= 3:  # Higher threshold
    return best_topic
```

### Adding New Keywords

**Location**: `_detect_cross_topic_query()` method, `topic_keywords` dictionary

```python
topic_keywords = {
    'admissions_enrollment': [
        # Existing keywords...
        'new_keyword_1', 'new_keyword_2'  # Add here
    ],
    # Other topics...
}
```

### Adding New Topics

1. **Add to `topic_keywords`**:

```python
topic_keywords = {
    # Existing topics...
    'new_topic': [
        'keyword1', 'keyword2', 'keyword3'
    ]
}
```

2. **Add to `TOPICS` in `topics.py`**:

```python
TOPICS = {
    # Existing topics...
    'new_topic': {
        'label': 'New Topic Label',
        'keywords': [...],
        'description': 'Description of new topic'
    }
}
```

3. **Add to `_get_topic_specific_instructions()`**:

```python
elif topic_id == 'new_topic':
    return """[Instructions for new topic]"""
```
