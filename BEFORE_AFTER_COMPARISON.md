# Before & After Comparison: Topic-Specific Instructions

## üéØ Summary

**CHANGE**: Added detailed, topic-specific instructions to the **Guided Chatbot Mode ONLY**  
**UNCHANGED**: Free Chat Mode (open-ended chatbot) remains with simple prompts

---

## üìä Before & After

### BEFORE: Generic Instructions for All Topics

```python
# Old prompt (line ~1974)
prompt = f"""<|system|>
You are an admissions assistant answering questions about {topic_label}.

RULES:
- Be direct and concise
- Use simple formatting
- No introductory phrases like "Based on the provided documentation"
- No closing phrases like "I hope this helps"
- Start directly with the answer
- Use numbered lists for steps
- Use bullet points for items
- Bold important terms only when necessary
</|system|>

<|context|>
{doc_context}
</|context|>

<|user|>
{query}
</|user|>

<|assistant|>
"""
```

**Problem**: Same generic instructions for all topics ‚Üí No guidance on:

- When to default to "new students" vs other student types
- How to handle program name variations (BS CS vs Computer Science)
- How to filter context when multiple student types/programs present
- Which programs to cover (undergraduate only)

---

### AFTER: Topic-Specific Instructions

```python
# New prompt (line ~1977)
prompt = f"""<|system|>
You are an ADDU (Ateneo de Davao University) Admissions Assistant.
You provide accurate, helpful information based strictly on the provided context documents.

{topic_specific_instructions}  # ‚Üê DYNAMICALLY INSERTED BASED ON TOPIC

GENERAL RESPONSE RULES:
- Be direct and concise
- Start directly with the answer
- Use bullet points for lists
- Use numbered lists for step-by-step processes
- Bold important terms and amounts
- No introductory phrases like "Based on the documents"
- No closing phrases like "I hope this helps"
- If information is not available in the context, state clearly what specific information is missing

CONTEXT MATCHING:
- Only use information that directly matches the user's specific query
- If context contains multiple student types/programs but user asked about one specific type, filter accordingly
- Prioritize exact matches over general information
</|system|>

<|context|>
{doc_context}
</|context|>

<|user|>
{query}
</|user|>

<|assistant|>
"""
```

**Solution**: Topic-specific instructions provide clear guidance on:

- ‚úÖ Default behaviors (e.g., new students for general admission queries)
- ‚úÖ Student type separation (4 types: new, transfer, international, scholar)
- ‚úÖ Program matching (name variations and acronyms)
- ‚úÖ Context filtering (exclude irrelevant student types/programs)
- ‚úÖ Scope limitations (undergraduate only, specific programs)

---

## üìù Example Topic Instructions

### 1. Admissions Topic Instructions

```
TOPIC-SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS FOR ADMISSIONS AND ENROLLMENT:

=== STUDENT TYPE HANDLING ===
- **DEFAULT BEHAVIOR**: If the user asks generally about "admissions" or "requirements"
  WITHOUT specifying a student type, provide information for **NEW STUDENTS ONLY**

- **SPECIFIC STUDENT TYPES**: If the user mentions a specific student type,
  provide information ONLY for that type:
  * **NEW STUDENTS**: First-time college students, freshmen, incoming students
  * **TRANSFER STUDENTS**: Students transferring from other institutions, shifters
  * **INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS**: Foreign students, overseas students, non-Filipino
  * **SCHOLAR STUDENTS**: Scholarship recipients, financial aid recipients

- **DO NOT MIX**: Never mix information from different student types in a single response

- **FOCUS**: Cover admission requirements, required documents, processes, and procedures
  specific to the identified student type
```

### 2. Programs Topic Instructions

```
TOPIC-SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS FOR PROGRAMS AND COURSES:

=== PROGRAM MATCHING ===
- **BASE RESPONSES** on the specific COURSE NAME and ACRONYM mentioned by the user
- **SCOPE**: Cover UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS ONLY (Bachelor's degrees, BS, BA programs)
- **MATCH VARIATIONS**: If user mentions a course name (e.g., "Computer Science")
  or acronym (e.g., "BSCS", "BS CS", "BS COMSCI"), provide information specific to that program
- **INCLUDE**: The whole document context given for the matched program
- **AVOID**: Graduate programs, master's degrees, doctoral programs, senior high school programs

=== PROGRAMS WE COVER ===
[Lists all 60+ undergraduate programs by school]
```

### 3. Fees Topic Instructions

```
TOPIC-SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS FOR FEES:

=== FEE INFORMATION HANDLING ===
- **BASE RESPONSES** on the specific COURSE/PROGRAM mentioned by the user
- **MATCH**: Provide fee information specific to the program the user asked about
- **INCLUDE**: Tuition fees, miscellaneous fees, payment schedules, installment options
- **DIFFERENTIATE**: Different programs may have different fee structures
- **SCOPE**: Undergraduate program fees only
```

## üîÑ Behavior Comparison

### Scenario 1: "What are the admission requirements?"

**BEFORE** (Generic Instructions):

```
Bot might return:
- Mix of new student, transfer, international requirements
- Unclear which type applies to the user
- Overwhelming amount of information
```

**AFTER** (Topic-Specific Instructions):

```
Bot returns:
- NEW STUDENT requirements ONLY (default behavior)
- Clear, focused information
- No mixing with other student types
```

---

### Scenario 2: "What are the requirements for transfer students?"

**BEFORE** (Generic Instructions):

```
Bot might return:
- Mix of transfer and new student requirements
- Some international student info mixed in
- Context not properly filtered
```

**AFTER** (Topic-Specific Instructions):

```
Bot returns:
- TRANSFER STUDENT requirements ONLY
- Filtered context (excludes new/international/scholar)
- Clear and specific to transfer students
```

---

### Scenario 3: "Tell me about BS CS"

**BEFORE** (Generic Instructions):

```
Bot might:
- Not recognize "BS CS" as "Computer Science"
- Return generic program information
- Mix undergraduate and graduate info
```

**AFTER** (Topic-Specific Instructions):

```
Bot returns:
- Recognizes "BS CS" = "Computer Science"
- Undergraduate BS Computer Science info only
- Full curriculum and course details
```

---

### Scenario 4: "How much is tuition for BS Nursing?"

**BEFORE** (Generic Instructions):

```
Bot might return:
- Generic tuition fees (not program-specific)
- Mix of different program fees
- Unclear which applies to Nursing
```

**AFTER** (Topic-Specific Instructions):

```
Bot returns:
- BS Nursing specific fees ONLY
- Includes nursing-specific fees (clinical, lab)
- Clear payment schedule for BSN
```

## üèóÔ∏è Implementation Details

### New Method Added

```python
def _get_topic_specific_instructions(self, topic_id: str) -> str:
    """Get specialized instructions based on the topic"""
    if topic_id == 'admissions_enrollment':
        return """[Detailed Admissions Instructions]"""
    elif topic_id == 'programs_courses':
        return """[Detailed Programs Instructions]"""
    elif topic_id == 'fees':
        return """[Detailed Fees Instructions]"""
    else:
        return """[Generic Instructions]"""
```

### Method Modified

```python
def _process_topic_query(self, query: str, topic_id: str) -> Tuple[str, List[Dict]]:
    """Process a query within a specific topic context"""
    # ... existing retrieval code ...

    # NEW: Get topic-specific instructions
    topic_specific_instructions = self._get_topic_specific_instructions(topic_id)

    # Build enhanced prompt with topic instructions
    prompt = f"""<|system|>
You are an ADDU Admissions Assistant...

{topic_specific_instructions}  # ‚Üê Dynamically injected

GENERAL RESPONSE RULES:
...
</|system|>
...
"""

    response = generate_response(prompt, max_tokens=3000)
    return response, relevant_docs
```

## ‚úÖ What Stays the Same

### 1. Free Chat Mode (Unchanged)

**Methods NOT Modified**:

- `process_query()` - Line 1661
- `process_query_stream()` - Line 2074

**Still use simple prompts**:

```python
prompt = f"""<|system|>
You are an admissions assistant. Answer questions using ONLY the provided context.

RULES:
- Be direct and concise
- Use simple formatting
...
</|system|>
"""
```

### 2. Document Retrieval (Unchanged)

- TF-IDF + Word2Vec hybrid scoring
- ChromaDB vector database
- Topic keyword filtering
- Metadata-based filtering

### 3. Frontend (Unchanged)

- React components
- Topic selection UI
- Guided vs Free toggle
- Chat interface
