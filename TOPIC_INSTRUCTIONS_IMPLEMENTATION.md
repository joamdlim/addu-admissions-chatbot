# Topic-Specific Instructions Implementation Summary

**Date**: October 6, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Completed  
**Scope**: Guided Chatbot Mode Only

---

## What Was Changed

### 1. Updated System Prompt in Guided Mode

**File**: `backend/chatbot/fast_hybrid_chatbot_together.py`

**Method Updated**: `_process_topic_query()`
- Enhanced system prompt to include topic-specific instructions
- Added dynamic instruction injection based on selected topic
- Maintained general response rules and context matching guidelines

### 2. Added Topic-Specific Instruction Helper

**New Method**: `_get_topic_specific_instructions(topic_id)`
- Returns specialized instructions for each topic
- Supports 3 main topics: admissions_enrollment, programs_courses, fees
- Fallback to generic instructions for other topics

---

## Topic-Specific Instructions

### üìã Admissions and Enrollment

**Key Behavior**:
- **DEFAULT**: Questions without student type ‚Üí NEW STUDENTS only
- **SPECIFIC**: Detects and separates 4 student types
  - New Students (freshmen, first-time)
  - Transfer Students (shifters, lateral entry)
  - International Students (foreign, overseas)
  - Scholar Students (scholarship, grant holders)
- **RULE**: Never mix information from different student types

### üéì Programs and Courses

**Key Behavior**:
- **SCOPE**: Undergraduate programs ONLY
- **MATCHING**: Handles course name variations
  - "Computer Science" = "BSCS" = "BS CS" = "BS COMSCI"
- **COVERAGE**: 60+ undergraduate programs across 4 schools
  - Arts and Sciences (31 programs)
  - Business and Governance (9 programs)
  - Education (6 programs)
  - Engineering and Architecture (10 programs)
  - Nursing (1 program)
- **AVOID**: Graduate, master's, doctoral, senior high programs

### üí∞ Fees

**Key Behavior**:
- **BASE**: Program-specific fee information
- **INCLUDE**: Tuition, miscellaneous, payment schedules, installments
- **DIFFERENTIATE**: Different programs = different fee structures
- **SCOPE**: Undergraduate program fees only

---

## What Was NOT Changed

### ‚úÖ Open-Ended Chat Mode Remains Unchanged

**Methods Unchanged**:
- `process_query()` - Regular chat processing
- `process_query_stream()` - Streaming chat processing

**These methods still use simple prompts**:
```
You are an admissions assistant. Answer questions using ONLY the provided context.
[Simple formatting rules]
```

### ‚úÖ Document Retrieval System Unchanged

- TF-IDF + Word2Vec hybrid retrieval still used
- ChromaDB vector database unchanged
- Topic keyword filtering still active
- Metadata-based document filtering still works

### ‚úÖ Frontend Unchanged

- React components work as before
- Topic selection UI unchanged
- Guided vs Free Chat toggle unchanged

---

## Benefits

1. **‚úÖ Accurate Context Filtering**: LLM knows exactly what to include/exclude
2. **‚úÖ Default Behaviors**: Clear defaults (e.g., new students for general admission queries)
3. **‚úÖ Program Matching**: Handles name/acronym variations
4. **‚úÖ Student Type Separation**: Prevents information mixing
5. **‚úÖ Maintainable**: Easy to update per-topic instructions
6. **‚úÖ Backward Compatible**: Free chat mode unchanged

---

## Testing

### Manual Testing

Run the test script:

```bash
cd backend
python chatbot/test_topic_instructions.py
```

**Test Coverage**:
1. ‚úÖ Admissions default ‚Üí NEW STUDENTS
2. ‚úÖ Admissions transfer ‚Üí TRANSFER only
3. ‚úÖ Programs acronym ‚Üí Matched correctly
4. ‚úÖ Programs name ‚Üí Curriculum provided
5. ‚úÖ Fees program-specific ‚Üí Correct fees
6. ‚úÖ Change topic ‚Üí Works
7. ‚úÖ Ask another ‚Üí Same topic

### Checklist for Verification

When testing, verify:
- [ ] General admissions query returns NEW STUDENT info only
- [ ] Transfer query returns TRANSFER info only (no mixing)
- [ ] "BS CS" matches "Computer Science" program
- [ ] Program queries return undergraduate info only
- [ ] Fee queries return program-specific fees
- [ ] Context filtering works (no irrelevant info)
- [ ] Responses are direct and concise
- [ ] No "Based on documents" phrases
- [ ] Bold formatting on important terms

## Usage

### For Users (Frontend)

1. Toggle to **Guided Mode**
2. Select a topic (Admissions, Programs, or Fees)
3. Ask questions naturally
4. System applies topic-specific instructions automatically

### For Developers (Backend)

**To modify instructions**:
```python
def _get_topic_specific_instructions(self, topic_id: str) -> str:
    if topic_id == 'admissions_enrollment':
        return """[Your updated instructions here]"""
```

**To add new topic**:
1. Add topic to `backend/chatbot/topics.py`
2. Add case in `_get_topic_specific_instructions()`
3. Define specialized instructions for that topic

---

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

1. **Student Type Pre-filtering**: Detect student type and filter docs before retrieval
2. **Program Name Normalization**: Map all variations to canonical names
3. **Multi-Program Comparison**: Allow comparison queries
4. **Contextual Memory**: Remember previous topic/program in conversation
5. **Dynamic Instruction Generation**: Generate instructions from document metadata

---

## Maintenance

### To Update Instructions

1. Open `backend/chatbot/fast_hybrid_chatbot_together.py`
2. Find `_get_topic_specific_instructions()` method (line ~1954)
3. Modify instructions for your topic
4. Test with `test_topic_instructions.py`
5. Update documentation

### To Debug

Enable debug output:
```python
# In _process_topic_query()
print(f"üéØ Topic: {topic_id}")
print(f"üìù Instructions: {topic_specific_instructions[:200]}...")
print(f"üìÑ Retrieved docs: {len(relevant_docs)}")
```

---

## Notes

- **Prompt Engineering Approach**: Instructions are in the prompt, not hard-coded logic
- **LLM Interpretation**: Together AI interprets and follows these instructions
- **Fallback Behavior**: If instructions unclear, LLM uses general knowledge
- **Context Size**: Instructions add ~500 tokens to prompt (acceptable overhead)

---

- [x] Open-ended mode unchanged
- [x] Topic-specific instructions implemented
